## To Do Tasks

### Core Requirements

1. **Persist Latest Cat Fact**  
   * **Goal:** Save the latest cat fact locally so it persists between app launches.  
   * **Implementation:** Use either **Room** or **DataStore** for data persistence.  
   * **Behavior:** Upon relaunching the app, the last fetched cat fact should be displayed without fetching from the network.  
2. **Display Fact Length**  
   * **Goal:** Show the character length of a cat fact when it exceeds 100 characters.  
   * **Implementation:** Use the `length` field from the API response.  
   * **Behavior:** If a fact's length is greater than 100, display the length on the Home screen at the position that you feel fit.  
3. **Indicate Multiple Cats**  
   * **Goal:** Inform the user when a fact contains the word **"cats"**.  
   * **Implementation:** Perform a simple text search for the word "cats" in the fact.  
   * **Behavior:** If the fact contains "cats", prominently display the text **"Multiple cats!"** on the Home screen.  
4. **Decorate Home screen**  
   * **Goal**: Add image(s) on the home screen  
   * **Implementation**: Perform Image download over network using Coil (you can use any image readily available on the internet)  
   * **Behavior**: You can show any image on the home screen that you think makes the screen more appealing to the users.
5. **Unit Testing**  
   * **Goal:** Ensure the reliability of your code through testing.
   * **Implementation:** Write unit tests for the **ViewModel** and **business logic** layers using `fake` or `mockk`.  
   * **Requirements:** Tests should cover happy paths and critical scenarios.

* **Architecture:** MVVM  
* **Libraries & Tools:**  
  * **Kotlin Coroutines** & **Flow**  
  * **Jetpack Compose** for UI  
    * If you donâ€™t have experience, please challenge yourself!  
  * **Hilt** for dependency injection  
  * **Room** or **DataStore** for local data persistence  
  * **Coil** for Image downloader  
* **Minimum SDK Version:** 26  
* **Target SDK Version:** Latest stable version
